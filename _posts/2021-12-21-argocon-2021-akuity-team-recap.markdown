# ArgoCon 2021 Akuity Team Recap

We just concluded [the inaugural ArgoCon](https://argoproj.github.io/argocon21/)! We'd like to share some impressive numbers from this conference and recap on the four sessions from the Akuity team.

## The Numbers

First, let's look at some numbers that came out from this conference.

* 3,893 registrants with 1,800 unique attendees over the day from 90 countries and more than 1500 companies.
* 20 sessions from 25 speakers, including 4 sessions from Akuity team.
* 6,200+ live session views and 2,600+ on demand views across all talks.
* 8 corporate sponsors.

These are really impressive numbers and we just got started for this first-ever Argo conference! 

We are proud to be one of the diamond sponsors of ArgoCon and [4 of the talks were given by our team members at Akuity](https://akuity.io/resources)!

Our team consists of the founding members and core maintainers of Argo. We've been involved in every perspective of the Argo projects and we will invest in what’s needed to foster the project’s growth. This includes continuing our contributions to the project, supporting users with their issues, facilitating discussions and meetings, and promoting Argo every chance we get. If this interests you, [please reach out and we are actively hiring](https://akuity.io/careers)!

The Argo community is growing fast and has been leading the chart with a large number of open source contributors and development activities. Argo is ranked as one of the top projects among all the CNCF projects in terms of development velocity, based on activities on GitHub commits/PRs/issues (see the screenshot below).
