<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TerryTangYuan">Yuan Tang</a>’s name is associated with some of the most touted projects in open source. Co-chair of <a href="https://github.com/kubeflow">Kubeflow</a> and a maintainer of CNCF’s <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow">TensorFlow</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost">XGBoost</a>, Yuan is also a founding engineer at <a href="http://akuity.io/?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=hcn">Akuity</a>,
 a startup founded by the creators of Argo. Akuity’s goal is to 
accelerate and simplify the implementation of GitOps practices into 
Kubernetes cluster management, using Argo. He has contributed to and 
co-authored <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/terrytangyuan">numerous additional open source projects</a>, <a href="https://github.com/terrytangyuan/public-talks">spoken at various conferences</a>, such as KubeCon and ArgoCon, co-authored <em>TensorFlow in Practice </em>and
 two more books on machine learning, and served four times as a mentor 
through Google Summer of Code. In addition, he has also held technical 
advisor and leadership positions at<a href="https://terrytangyuan.github.io/cv#services"> various companies and open source organizations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did Yuan reach his position in the open source and cloud native 
worlds? It all began when he filed his first bug on GitHub.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yuan was introduced to cloud native tools and methodology as an 
engineer at Alibaba Group working on machine learning infrastructure. 
When his team shifted their distributed and ML workloads to Kubernetes, 
they gravitated to Kubeflow. At first fixing small bugs and adding 
documentation, his contributions increased until he eventually rose to a
 tech lead and co-chair, focusing on distributed ML model training and 
actively <a href="https://youtu.be/jyLi1cfJeM8">advocating the project through conferences such as KubeCon 
Europe</a>.</p>


<p>Yuan’s involvement in Argo traces a similar upward trajectory from 
modest beginnings. In need of workflow orchestration tools, his team 
adopted <a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows">Argo Workflows</a>,
 and Yuan again began making contributions wherever he spotted the need.
 After two years, he became a project maintainer, and, after departing 
Alibaba, joined Akuity with some of the original project authors. 
Besides regular code contributions and reviews and GitHub issue 
triaging, he has continued to contribute to the Argo ecosystem by 
speaking at conferences, hosting contributor meetings, writing the <a href="https://bit.ly/2RKv8Zo"><em>Distributed Machine Learning Patterns</em></a> book, which covers Argo, and curating the <a href="https://github.com/terrytangyuan/awesome-argo">list of “Awesome Argo” resources related to the project</a>.</p>



<p>Having benefited from the meritocracy of open source himself, Yuan 
now tries to bring visibility and credit wherever it is due in open 
source communities. For example, he mentored a student from India on the
 Kubeflow project in 2020, and <a href="https://twitter.com/TerryTangYuan/status/1462638153836244999">eventually wrote a recommendation letter 
for his graduate school application to Georgia Tech, where he now 
studies</a>. “We are still maintaining that relationship on social media. 
Every once in a while, I’ll post something on Twitter or LinkedIn, and 
he’ll follow up. And if he has any questions, he’ll ask,” Yuan said. 
“It’s rewarding.”</p>


<p>He advises users of open source projects to file any bugs they come 
across, and if they have ideas to improve a project, submit a feature 
request on GitHub. They can also join community meetings around a 
particular project to present any use cases, or even new projects, based
 upon it. </p>

<p>“The spirit of community is inspiring. I truly believe that the more 
you give, the more you receive, and this idea really applies to the open
 source community.”</p>
<cite>Yuan Tang </cite></blockquote>



<p>As democratic as open source is, however, Yuan says there are smaller
 projects that do not receive the attention they deserve. He believes 
the community has the power to elevate these projects and the people 
behind them through social media, even lending his own clout to the 
cause. “ I’m not a big influencer, but I do have a number of followers 
on social media. So if you know any project, feel free to let me know 
and I’d love to share,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yuan manages to remain active in open source – as a contributor, 
maintainer and mentor – while also juggling family life with two kids, 
sometimes putting in work on nights and weekends. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-smaller-quote">
<p>“Sometimes it’s overwhelming, but it’s inspiring whenever we see a 
report from our users, and we know that they are using the project and 
some of the new features we’ve developed.” </p>
